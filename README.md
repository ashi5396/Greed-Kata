# Greed Kata Assignment
### Ashi Chamarasinghe

Questions and assumptions
1. What is Greed Kata and how to play it?
2. Which data structure should I use?
   - Regular Array : Good data structure but when I want to remove items, has to go through the entire array.
   - Dictionary - Heard about it through Python but not familiar using it in c# and with the limited time did not 
                              have enough time to study.
   - ArrayList vs List - A good data structure and can easily access elements. 
3. How to design?
   - Console application that allows the user to play the game or quit the game
		
Different Paths 
1. Data Structure : ArrayList vs List
   - First started with an arrayList.To sum triplScore,need to keep track of count for each variable. 
		But with arrayList it is hard since I have to go through each element every time. However,with List, 
		it does give me the option to group by values and their counts. Therefore, decided to use a List. 
2. Interface vs Abstraction
   - Was not entirely sure which one to use. Since I had different rules, decided to use interface rather than abstraction. I do not 		have any other inheritance in my program therefore decided not to use abstraction. 
3. How many player
   - Not sure how many players or how many chances a player gets, so decided to create a console application that 
                allows the player to play the game or to exit the game.
